<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a psychology student currently learning web development. It is hard, but I think it will pay off in the future when 
  I am able to help my parent financially. I'm 25 years old and I train football.</p>

<p>I am lucky to have so many good people around me. My friends are always there to help and support me. I don't know what I did to deserve
  them, but I really am greatuful.</p>

<p>I am currently employed in a company that provides customer service for one energy supplier in the UK. It is a relatively easy job, but 
  it can get really mentally demanding and frustrating. That is enough for now.</p>
